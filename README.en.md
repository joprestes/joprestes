# Hello, world! I'm Joelma Prestes, but you can call me J√¥. üëã

### Software Quality Engineer & Tech Lead | Passionate about building bridges between people, processes, and technology.

If you've made it this far, you probably share the same belief I do: **quality isn't just about finding bugs; it's about building a culture that prevents them from happening in the first place**.

My journey in technology is a bit different from the traditional path. I started in 2021, at 36, through a career transition driven by the **Reset** program. What began with the challenge of learning manual testing blossomed into a genuine passion for automation, accessibility, performance, and, most importantly, the strategy behind a robust and inclusive digital product.

Today, as an **Engineering Lead at CWI**, my purpose is to guide and empower teams to make quality everyone's responsibility. My focus goes beyond "does it work?" to answer questions like:
- How do we ensure our test automation builds confidence and accelerates value delivery?
- Is our product truly accessible to everyone?
- How do we use data and observability (QAOps) to make smarter decisions?

This space is my continuous learning lab. Here you'll find projects, proofs-of-concept, and studies related to the areas that drive my day-to-day work.

### üå± My Current Focus

- **Technical Leadership & Mentorship:** Helping shape the next generation of QA professionals.
- **Quality Culture:** Spreading quality practices throughout the entire development lifecycle.
- **QAOps & Test Strategy:** Optimizing CI/CD pipelines to scale testing safely and intelligently.
- **Digital Accessibility (a11y):** Ensuring the web is a place for everyone.
- **Non-Functional Testing:** Exploring the worlds of performance, security, and usability.

### ‚úçÔ∏è Sharing the Journey

I believe the best way to solidify knowledge is by sharing it. That's why I write articles on Medium about my challenges, learnings, and reflections in the Quality Assurance field. My goal is to demystify concepts and inspire others who, like me, are on or dream of being on a career path in tech.
